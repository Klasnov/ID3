# ID3 Decision Tree Algorithm with Pruning

This is a Python implementation of the ID3 decision tree algorithm with a pruning strategy. It was developed by Yanming Shao and Baitong Lu and is compatible with Python 3.11.



## Overview

The ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm is a popular decision tree learning algorithm. It is used for classification tasks and is based on information gain to select the best attributes for splitting the data. This implementation also includes a pruning strategy to limit the depth of the tree and improve its generalization.



## Project Structure

The project directory includes the following files and folders:

- `id3.py`: This is the main Python script containing the implementation of the ID3 decision tree algorithm, including pruning.
- `README.md`: This readme file.
- `data/`: A directory containing the dataset files.
  - `train.csv`: This is the training dataset used to build the decision tree.
  - `predict.csv`: This is the dataset for making predictions using the decision tree.
  - `result.csv`: This file will be generated by the script to store the predicted results.



## Usage

To use this implementation of the ID3 decision tree algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.11 installed.

2. Install the required Python libraries if you haven't already. You can use `pip` to install them:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

3. Run the `id3.py` script to build the decision tree and make predictions. The script performs the following steps:
- Reads the training and prediction datasets from `train.csv` and `predict.csv`.
- Builds a decision tree with optional maximum depth pruning (defined by `max_depth` in the script).
- Makes predictions on the `predict.csv` dataset and stores the results in `result.csv`.



## Dataset

The training dataset (`train.csv`) should be structured with features (attributes) and a target attribute. In this implementation, the target attribute is specified as 'weather'. You can modify the `target_attribute` variable in the script to match your dataset.



## Customization

You can customize the behavior of the decision tree by adjusting the parameters in the script, such as the maximum depth for pruning and the target attribute. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your specific needs.
